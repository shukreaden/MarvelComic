# Marvel Comic

Marvel comic application that displays a single comic title, description, and cover image via the comic endpoint from Marvels Api(https://gateway.marvel.com:443/v1/public/comics/). Also adds UI tests for checking that the comic's content is displayed properly(shows comic image, title, and description as well as shows comic accessory buttons -> "read now", "mark as read", "add to library" and "read offline"). Also adds a single unit test for making sure the timestamp added to the Marvel api call is formatted correctly.
